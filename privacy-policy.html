                Valneva SE and its affiliates (“<b>Valneva</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>” or “<b>our</b>”) have created this privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our processing of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) in accordance with applicable law, including Canada’s <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (“<b>PIPEDA</b>”) with regard to the use of our website and several listed aspects, for example, pharmacovigilance or customer data.</p> 
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">This Privacy Policy applies to individuals we deal with including consumers, patients, health care professionals, and others within the health care or pharmaceutical industries (“<b>you</b>” or “<b>your</b>”), and explains how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process and protect your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy further includes a description of your privacy rights.</p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description"> <strong class="blue">Use of the Websites </strong><br />Our websites and the subsites may collect and process data regarding your behavior on our website in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with your consent, where required. If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in this way, please do not use the websites or provide us with Personal Information. </p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">The websites may collect information from visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via email and/or feedback forms. Some of the information that you submit on the Site may be Personal Information. A site may further use “cookies” and Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. A cookie is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences and an IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider. The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the site.</p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description"><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Valneva has activated IP anonymization on its websites, therefore, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within applicable jurisdictions. </p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">Only in exceptional cases the full IP address might be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this anonymized information for the purpose of evaluating the use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data from Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de). We would like to point out that on our websites Google Analytics has been extended by the code “anonymizeIp” in order to ensure anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).</p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">Please note that if you wish to subscribe and connect your personal social media account to our Site, e.g. if you would like to share information on your own social media account, certain Personal Information will be shared with us such as Personal Information linked to your profile or your friends’ profiles on the applicable social media account.</p>
              </p>
              <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">  <strong class="blue">Pharmacovigilance</strong> <br />
                Pharmacovigilance is the process of discovering, evaluating, understanding, and preventing adverse reactions or other problems related to medicines. Their notification is of great importance for public health. We will only use and share this information for pharmacovigilance purposes. This processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Valneva is subject.</p>

                <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">Valneva is required to store and report information relevant to pharmacovigilance to health authorities worldwide (including countries whose privacy laws differ from those of  your local jurisdiction). The reports contain detailed information on the incident, but only to a limited extent Personal Information.</p>
                
                <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description">Concerning patients, the notification will contain, if available, only age, date of birth, year of birth, gender, and initials, depending on the information available, but never the name of the patient. With regard to the person reporting a potential adverse reaction, the notification will include, depending on the information available, the name, professional activity (e.g. doctor, pharmacist), address, e-mail address, and telephone number. The contact details are necessary to be able to follow up the reporting and thus obtain high-quality and complete information on adverse events. Information on notifications will be kept for at least ten (10) years after the product is no longer on the market in any country.</p>

                <p class="text-left privacy-policy-description"><strong class="blue">Recruitment</strong><br />
                  We will store and process your data for the purpose of your application based on your consent and in accordance with applicable law.

We will keep your Personal Information in evidence for filling additional positions for a maximum period of seven months from the date of the receipt of your application.
