                7. Disclaimer of Warranties With Respect to Use of Site
                <br />
                THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.
                EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
                ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, LEGAL OR IMPLIED,
                INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
                NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                <br />
                WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR
                REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ACCESS TO THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
                TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS, IF ANY, WILL BE
                CORRECTED. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE

                QUALITY, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE
                SITE.
                <br />
                YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA
                DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE IS
                USED AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
                FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT

                NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.
                <br />
                <br />
                8. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Arbitration; Class Action
                Waiver
                <br />
                The information on the Site is intended only for use by
                residents of Canada. Other countries may have laws, regulatory
                requirements, or medical practices that differ from those in
                Canada.
                <br />
                With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating
                to the Site or these Terms of Use (including without limitation
                the Privacy Policy), Valneva and you agree to negotiate in good
                faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one
                another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.
                If you and the Valneva do not resolve any dispute by informal
                negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be
                conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in
                this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or
                participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court
                before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved
                before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final. Any
                court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the
                arbitrator’s award.
                <br />
                YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE
                ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN
                INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR VALNEVA WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY
                DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN
                WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE
                CAPACITY. No arbitration or other proceeding will be combined
                with another without the prior written consent of all parties to
                all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
                <br />
                Valneva and you agree that all disputes arising under these
                Terms of Use that cannot be settled through informal negotiation
                will be settled exclusively through confidential binding
                arbitration. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be
                entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You
                agree that the Valneva may seek any interim or preliminary
                relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario
                necessary to protect its rights or property pending the
                completion of arbitration.
                <br />
                Any claims not subject to arbitration shall be subject to the
                exclusive jurisdiction of the Province of Ontario, and you agree
                to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such
                courts. Use of the Site constitutes consent to the application
                of those laws, as well as of the following terms and conditions.

                <br />
                <br />
                9. Limitations of Liability
                <br />
                YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
                WILL VALNEVA, ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
                DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, MANDATARIES OR OTHER
                REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
                INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR AGGRAVATED DAMAGES,
                INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF INCOME,
                SAVING OR PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COST OF
                PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT,
                SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWSOEVER CAUSED,
                AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
                TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE
                RESULTING FROM (1) THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE
                WEBSITE; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES,
                ITEMS, OR WEBSITES; (3) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF
                YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION); (4)
                THE STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE WEBSITE; OR
                (5) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE WEBSITE. THESE LIMITATIONS
                WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT VALNEVA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF
